# Udemy - Testing React with Jest and Testing Library

## How to run

```shell
cd color button
npm test
```

## Notes

- Test your software the way users actually use it
- Providers a virtual DOM for tests allowing us to render, search and interact with the components
- Jest is the recommended to use with Testing Library
- Jest Watch Mode allow to continuously run the tests. Every time we change a file it will run the test again.
-  It's a functional test since it's focused in the behaviour
